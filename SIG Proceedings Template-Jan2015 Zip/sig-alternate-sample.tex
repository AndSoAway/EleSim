\section{Introduction}
China has gone through a rapid economic growth in the past three decades, and economy boosting in east china area has been always a highlight. Ever since, electricity has been a powerful catalyst for social development and economic growth. Empirically, economic fluctuation would cause changes in electricity consumption and electricity consumption can also reflect the economic change. There has been much interests in the causal relationship between economic growth and electricity consumption using the regression or statistical method. However, though the economic indicators and electricity consumption can be viewed as time series and lots of trajectory similarity methods exist, a big gap still lies midst them. Our work in this paper would focus on the exploit of internal link between economic indicators and electricity consumption using trajectory similarity.

Nowadays, the GDP growth has slower to blew 7\%, which officially is called "new normal". Economic policies would adjust to this new situation, thus asking energy strategies to change. Consequently, the study of the casual relationship between economic indicators and the electricity consumption would shed light on future energy policies, such as the energy conservation, the planning of capacity expansion and the reliable supply of electricity.
  
There are numerous economic indicators and previous work mainly focused on the simple GDP. The study of the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth started with the seminal work of \cite{kraft:relationship}, in which causality between the energy consumption and GNP growth was found using Granger test. Subsequently, actual circumstances in the developed countries was studied like the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy\cite{yu:causal, erol1987causal}. Due to the boosting prosperity, Asian economy also attracted the eyes of researchers like South Korea and Singapore. The cointegration and error-correction models were also applied to research from the viewpoint of the time-series\cite{glasure1998cointegration}.

However, previous work just treat the data as 

Compare to the previous work, our paper has made the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item We proposed an similarity metrics that 
	\item We focused on specific provinces in the east China.
	\item Quantitive indicators are tested and the most closely connected are sought.
\end{itemize}

The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. We formalize our question in section 2 and introduce our algorithms in section 3. In section 4, we will elaborate our experiments and highlight our contributions. At last, the section 5 will give the conclusion and the future work.

\section{Problem Formulation}
In this section, we will formalize our work into a segement-similarity question and define the notations that we need in the blow.

The time series of economic indicators and electricity consumption would be viewed as a segment. We should evaluate the correlation of economic indicators with electricity consumption through the similarity between the two segments like in Fig 1.[[[[[Here , we should  put one Picture of two examples]]]]] . Before we elaborate the concise similarity problem, we firstly define some relevant notations.
\newcommand{\loci}[1]{\ensuremath{p^{#1}}}
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
Suppose we have a series of data in \textit{n} months, each monthly data is composed by \textbf{\{date, val\}}, in which $date$ is the month, and $val$ is the value of economic indicator or electricity consumption. A \textit{segment $T$} is a sequence of data points, i.e.$This place is suspicious$, $T=\{\loci{1}, \loci{2}, \cdots, \loci{|T|}\}$,  where $\loci{k}$ is a data point. And $|T|$ is the number of data points in $T$.
\end{definition}

And then, we would use the area of the polygon enclosed by two segments to evaluate the relevance between the economic indicators and the electricity consumption. Given two segments, it is very obvious to see that the less the enclosed area of these two segments is, the more similar the tendency of these two series is. The area enclosed by two segments is usually calculate by:
\begin{displaymath}
\textbf{S} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\Delta S_k	
\end{displaymath}

Each part of the enclosed polygon \textit{$\Delta S_k$} is that the area of shape enclosed by the two segments and vertical coordinates. According to the different tendencies, we can conclude just two cases.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two segments doesn't intersect. Then, the enclosed part is a trapezoid, of which area is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta S_k = \frac{(a + b) * (t_{k+1} - t_k)}{2}
\end{equation}
	\item Two segments intersects. Then, we can treat it as the sum of two triangles.
\begin{equation}
	\Delta S_k = \frac{a * h_i}{2} + \frac{b * h_j}{2}, h_i + h_j = t_{k+1} - t_k 
\end{equation}
\end{itemize} 

Though we have proposed the area of two segments, it cannot be used to evaluate the similarity of two segments. We want to compare the tendency of two indexes. So, case may be that if two lines goes in the same direction but their distance is very long, we still get the much larger area. So, we can move one of the two lines vertically. With different distances, we would get different area, from which the least area is the most appropriate value to reflect the coincide. So, we could use the notation of MINS as the real area.
\begin{equation}
	MINS = \min{\textbf{S}}	
\end{equation}

Given the statistical report, we could know that different indicators exist the time offset. Given two segments, if we move one of them horizontally, we could get different \textbf{MINS}. Among all the results, the time offset corresponding to the least val is a candidate for the real time offset. Once we got the least similarity for economic indicators, we could rank the similarities of these indicators and found the top-k indicators closely connected to the electricity consumption. We can formalize our problem as one top-k problem as follow:
\begin{definition}
	[[[This part, we can put the top-K problem]]]]
\end{definition} 
\section{Algorithms}
In this section, we describe a novel top-k algorithm based on the area similarity to find the top-k relevant economic indicators.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
