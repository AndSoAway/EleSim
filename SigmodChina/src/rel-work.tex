Different to the traditional Granger test or regression analysis, we treat the economic indicators and electricity consumption data as trajectories. We have proposed an trajectory similarity based on the least enclosed by two trajectory. Meanwhile we conducted another three traditional trajectory similarity method to evaluate how much the economic indicators are relevant with the electricity consumption. We have find the top-k indicators close with electricity consumption using these four similarity method. And we also use these similarity method to verify the lagging phenomenon between electricity consumption and economic indicators. We analyze the results of our experiments and give our conclusion about how to predict the economic tendency.
